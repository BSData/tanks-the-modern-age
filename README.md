## Overview ##
[Overview]: #overview

This repository contains BattleScribe data for the Gale Force 9 game, Tanks: The Modern Age.

This was released in 2018 and brought the Tanks tabletop game into the Cold War era. It is **not** compatible with either Tanks: World War 2 (2016) or World Of Tanks: Miniatures Game (2020) from the same company.

This repository contains Battlescribe data for USA, Soviet, British, French and German forces. I don't have any of the French or German forces so they are missing any country or expansion specific hero, crew and upgrade cards, but you can create a platoon with the basic vehicles and global upgrades.

This repository contains all Global, USA and Soviet cards from Starter Set as well as the hero, crew and upgrade cards from the following Expansions:
* British Cheiftain
* British Scimitar
* British Striker
* British	Lynx Helicopter
* USA	M1 Abrams
* USA	M60 Patton
* USA	LAV
* USA	M901 ITV
* USA Cobra
* Soviet T-55
* Soviet T-72
* Soviet Hind

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Now, you have some options:

1. [Report it on AppSpot][] - it's anonymous and no account is needed - on downside, you'll need to manually check on the progress of your issue.

2. [Open issue directly][] (green `New Issue` in upper-right, GitHub account required) - you can track the progress, get notifications, help us by answering possibly follow-up questions and help us better!
